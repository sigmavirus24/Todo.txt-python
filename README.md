# todo.py

A port of the [popular todo.txt-cli
project](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli) from bash to
python.

# Dependencies

This only requires
[GitPython](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython) if you want to
have todo.py also manage a git repository which tracks the related files.
Running the script once will give you the URL to download it. Please note that
GitPython is written for `git --version` 1.7.2+.

# Hacking

Enjoy, contribute, and feel free to clone. I'm doing this blind[1] as best as
possible for fun.

# Footnotes

[1] By blind, I mean without looking at the source of the original todo.txt-cli
project. I'm working solely from my experiences with the script and
experimenting with the functionality while adding things I should probably write
as patches and send upstream... I'll wait to finish my version of the project
first though.
